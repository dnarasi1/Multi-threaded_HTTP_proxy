# Multi-threaded_HTTP_proxy

# 1 Background

HTTP GET requests are used to request data from the specified source. For example, if we want to access a webpage at http://www.foo.com/bar.html, our browser will send something similar to the following HTTP GET request.

GET /bar.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.foo.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,/;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive

In the above example, our browser is the client, and Host: www.foo.com is the server host name. The client is requesting server resource located at /bar.html. Usually, HTTP servers run on port 80. So, by default, the server port number is 80. If, for example, the HTTP server runs on port 8080, then the URL would be http://www.foo.com:8080/bar.html, and the Host field in the HTTP request will also contain the port number: www.foo.com:8080. The HTTP server responds with HTTP response. A valid HTTP response includes: (1) the status line, (2) the response header, and (3) the entity body. For example, the text below shows an example HTTP response. Notice that this response header includes a field: Content-Length, which tells the client how much data to expect.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 02 Apr 2015 01:51:49 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.16 (Debian) Last-Modified: Tue, 10 Feb 2015 17:56:15 GMT ETag: "56638402b-a85-50ebf9a5ecdc0" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 2693 Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1 ... ...

An HTTP proxy is an application that resides between the HTTP client and server. The HTTP proxy relays the client’s HTTP requests to the HTTP server, and forwards the server’s response back to the client. Proxies are often 1 used when the client cannot directly connect with the HTTP server. If a client is configured to use an HTTP proxy, the HTTP GET request it sends out will not only include path to the resource at the server, but also the server host name. For example, the request would look like:

GET http://www.foo.com/bar.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.foo.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,/;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive

To request the resource for the client, the HTTP proxy starts a new TCP connection with the server host www.foo.com at port number 80 and ask for file bar.html. When the HTTP proxy relays this request from the client, it will have to remove the host name, http://www.foo.com from the request line of the GET request, so that the request line specifies only the local resource path at the destination server. When the HTTP response arrives at the proxy, the proxy will forward it to the client. If the proxy is correctly implemented, a client web-browser should be able to display the requested resource.

# 2 Task I: Multi-threaded HTTP Proxy

HTTP proxy should support a subset of the HTTP standard. It only needs to forward HTTP GET requests and should only support basic portions of the standard. That is, we do not need to support persistent connections, request pipelining or other, advanced portions of the standard. Proxy must only correctly handle HTTP requests where a single request/response pair is sent over a single TCP connection. Specifically, proxy should operate as follows: • It should create a TCP server socket to listen for incoming TCP connections on an unused port, and output the host name and port number the proxy is running on. • When a new connection request comes in, the proxy accepts the connection, establising a TCP connection with the client. • The proxy reads HTTP request sent from the client and prepares an HTTP request to send to the HTTP server. • The proxy starts a new connection with the HTTP server, and sends its prepared HTTP request to the server. • The proxy reads the HTTP response and forwards the HTTP response (the status line, the response header, and the entity body). • The proxy closes the TCP connection with the server. • The proxy sends the server’s response back to the client via its TCP connection with the client. This TCP connection with the client should have remained open during its communication with the server. Also note that the proxy should use Content-Length to determine how much response content to read from the server and forward to the client. • The proxy closes the connection socket to the client. To maintain a high level of throughput even under multiple simultaneous client requests, different requests should be handled in different threads, with a new thread created for each client request. In this Project, we are required to use the pthreads (POSIX threads) library for the multi-threaded proxy implementation.

# 2.1 How to test our implementation

First download a resource located at a URL using the wget command without the proxy. This is the correct resource. Then we download the same resource at the same URL with our proxy. Use the diff command to check if the two downloaded resources matches. Suppose our HTTP proxy is started on remote02.cs.binghamton.edu port 47590. we can run the following Bash shell command in an EMPTY directory on a remote.cs computer to download web resource via our proxy. $> bash $> export http_proxy=http://remote02.cs.binghamton.edu:47590 && wget http://www.foo.com/bar.html To download without the HTTP proxy, use the following command: $> export http_proxy="" && wget http://www.foo.com/bar.html Note: • we MUST replace http://www.foo.com/bar.html with a valid URL. • Since this is only an HTTP proxy, not an HTTPS proxy, our URL MUST use HTTP, not HTTPS. • we may also run our HTTP proxy on our own machine and use Wireshark for debugging. • our web browser also has a cache. A second request for the same URL may be directly served by our browser cache without going through the proxy. Therefore, we are recommended to use wget for debugging and testing.
